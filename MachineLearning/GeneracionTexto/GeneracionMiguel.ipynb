    "Respecto a la creación de texto, una temperatura baja hace que los caracteres más probables segun la distribucion de probabilidad calculada por el modelo aumenten la probabilidad de ser elegidos, y que la probabilidad del resto de caracteres se subestime, por lo que el texto que se genera tiende a parecerse al texto sobre el que se ha entrenado. Sin embargo, se observa que tiende a repetir grupos de palabras.\n",

    "Al aumentar la temperatura hacia uno, la distribución después de aplicar la temperatura es parecida a la que devuelve el modelo. En este caso, se tienen más en cuenta los valores que son un poco menos probables. Por tanto,\n",
    "aumenta la variablidad de las palabras formadas, como se ve en los textos escritos para temperatura 0.9. \n",
    "El inconveniente es que al contemplar más opciones a la hora de añadir un carácter, es más facil que se creen palabras que, aunque tengan una construcción que parezca más o menos propia del idioma de entrenamiento, no existan. Por tanto, en función del grado de precisión del modelo, el grado de coherencia que queramos, y de la creatividad que busquemos, conviene elegir una temperatura u otra. \n",
    "\n",
    "En conclusión, para crear texto nuevo a partir del libro escogido, las temperaturas 0.3 o 0.9 serían más adecuadas, siendo 0.9 más arriesgada por poder introducir palabras erróneas. Para mejorar esto, sería importante encontrar formas de mejorar la precisión del modelo (accuracy), que, como vemos, se estabiliza en torno al 60%, lo que se nota en la falta de sentido de las frases."
